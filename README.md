Simple sunset sundown calculator
For all the mathematical logic it uses assembly (FPU, but in the comments you can find an alternate code that uses SIMD instructions instead)
For frontend it uses C++

Project was made as college project with the purpose to learn to use the FPU in assembly
Can(?) be used as a reference to learn how the FPU works

Code for Sunrise/sunset algorithm starts at ./domms.asm line 542
