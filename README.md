Simple sunset sundown calculator
For all the mathematical logic it uses assembly (FPU, but in the comments you can find an alternate code(dooms.asm) that uses SIMD instructions instead)
For frontend it uses C++ with Allegro

Project was made as college project with the purpose to learn to use the FPU in assembly
Can(?) be used as a reference to give a sense on how the FPU works

Code for Sunrise/sunset algorithm starts at ./domms.asm line **542**

Also comments are in **spanish**,
i know that the project is a disaster(files everywhere, images missing, etc.) but im too lazy to actually go into this proyect that i made about two years ago(sincce this readme) and correct them, chances are you are only here for the assembly code, either way, its as much hocup pocus for me as it is for you since my coding pracices have evolved since then. So i wont invest time in actually fixing it.
